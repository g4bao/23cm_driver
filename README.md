Details of the now obsolete G4BAO 23cm driver kit
As published in Scatterpoint 91 January 2013
This PA was sold for many years as a kit by the designer. The PD85004 device is now obsolte so the decision has been made to not sell any further kits so the designs are now made avaialable here under the terms of an MIT licence. It includes a copy of the original article, Eagle board and schematic files, plus Gerber files for the PCB, which must be made from FR4 0.7mm substrate.
